# My lunacy project

this is my full repository for my lunacy project. Why? because why not? I love making things open source except for my music taste.

## lunacy

### installation

You can go to the official [lunacy website](https://icons8.com/lunacy). Or if you have [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) installed, you can use this command.
```
$  flatpak install lunacy
```
after that, you can have a full tour of my lunacy projects! Which sounds stupid but who cares.

## Results

Everything that is exported will be put inside the directory [result](https://github.com/berakpaijo/lunacy-projects-of-mine-because-why-not-/tree/main/results). So, if you ever wanted to take some images you can go inside it and you know, "steal" some of mine creations which btw I also use some free assets lmao. And PLEASE always put them inside the directory [result](https://github.com/berakpaijo/lunacy-projects-of-mine-because-why-not-/tree/main/results) if you ever had to change this repo for some magical reason...

## Thanks

thanks for your concern and time wasting just to go and have a look at my stupid idiotic lunacy project. And yes, everything that has "--wallpaper" in it's name is in fact a wallpaper that I use or used.

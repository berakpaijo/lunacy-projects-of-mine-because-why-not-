# My lunacy project

this is my full repository for my lunacy project. Why? because why not? I love making things open source except for my music taste.

## lunacy

### installation

You can go to the official [lunacy website](https://icons8.com/lunacy). Or if you have [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) installed, you can use this command.
```
$  flatpak install lunacy
```
Or with [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/)
```
$  snap install lunacy
```

after that, you can have a full tour of my lunacy projects! Which sounds stupid but who cares.

## Results

Everything that is exported will be put inside the directory [results](https://github.com/berakpaijo/lunacy-projects-of-mine-because-why-not-/tree/main/results). So, if you ever wanted to take some images you can go inside it and you know, "steal" some of my creations which btw I also use some free assets lmao. And PLEASE always put them inside the directory [results](https://github.com/berakpaijo/lunacy-projects-of-mine-because-why-not-/tree/main/results) if you ever had to change this repo for some magical reason...

## Thanks

thanks for your concern and time wasting just to go and have a look at my stupid idiotic lunacy project. And yes, everything that has "--wallpaper" in it's name is in fact a wallpaper that I use or used.

## Author's note

For those who's asking "where is the rei ayanami with longinus .free file?" Well, to asnwer that, I have lost it... You see, I make this entire repo with nixos and I don't feel like it to use nixos for my entire life. So uh... I uninstalled and now I'm using fedora, which btw I feel better with it's environment. And since I uninstalled my nixos, that means I also replaced it's formal partition with fedora. Yes, that is how I lost it, I FORMATTED WITHOUT THINKING TO BACKUP IT. And it's not only who is surprised by the fact that there's file missing, but it's also me. AND IT'S RIGHT THE TIME I AM WRITING THIS. This sounds stupid, VERY stupid. But believe me, IT HAS HAPPENED and there's nothing I can do... or maybe I recreate it but with fedora this time. To whoever read this, please don't be mad :'(
